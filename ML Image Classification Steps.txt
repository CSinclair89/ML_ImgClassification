Steps for ML Image Classification:

1.) Get mean/standard deviation of training data
2.) Declare train/test transforms
   - This is to establish things like size, rotation, and
     that each item is a tensor (.ToTensor)
   - Also be sure to normalize data w/ mean & standard deviation
3.) Declare train/test dataset variables using the transforms
4.) Declare Data Loaders which is what we'll pass to the Neural Network
   - Be sure to shuffle the training data but NOT the test data
5.) Establish 3 main functions:
   1.) Set the device to GPU for parallel computing (50x faster than CPU)
   2.) Train Neural Network function (nn.Module)
	- Either custom model or pre-defined/pre-trained models
	- ResNet18 (you can set "pretrained" as True/False
	- Linear function takes number of inputs/features as parameters
	  and prepared necessary matrices for roward propagation
   3.)
